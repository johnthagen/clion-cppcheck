# CLion-cppcheck

- Runs `cppcheck` on the fly while you write code.
- Highlights lines and displays `cppcheck` error messages.
- Supports passing options to `cppcheck`.

This project is supported with a free open source license of CLion from [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/?from=clion-cppcheck).

## Installation

See 
[Installing, Updating and Uninstalling Repository Plugins](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/managing-plugins.html)

- [`cppcheck` in JetBrains Plugin Repository][cppcheck_plugin]

## Usage

1. Install the [`cppcheck`](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/) tool using the instructions on its homepage. This plugin
   does **not** bundle the `cppcheck` tool itself, which must be installed separately.
2. Install the [cppcheck plugin][cppcheck_plugin] into CLion.
3. Configure the plugin with the **absolute** path to the `cppcheck` executable into the `cppcheck path` option.
    1. Windows
        1. File | Settings | cppcheck configuration
        2. Usually the path is `C:\Program Files (x86)\Cppcheck\cppcheck.exe`
    2. macOS: 
        1. CLion | Preferences | cppcheck configuration
        2. In a terminal run `which cppcheck` to find the path to `cppcheck`. If you installed it with 
           [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), the path will be `/usr/local/bin/cppcheck`.
    3. Linux
        1. File | Settings | cppcheck configuration
        2. In a terminal run `which cppcheck` to find the path to `cppcheck`. If you installed it with your
           system's package manager, it is probably located at `/usr/bin/cppcheck`.

## Known Issues

`cppcheck` is not designed to be run on header files (`.h`) directly, as must be done for this
plugin, and as a result may have false positives.

When run on header files directly, `cppcheck` defaults to C as the language, which will generate
false positives for C++ projects.  C++ projects should append `--language=c++` to the
`cppcheck` options.
